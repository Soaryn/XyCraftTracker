# XyCraftTracker

Public issue tracker and library documentation.
This is still currently WIP, so I thank you for your patience!

## Data Files

Some Data such as the world generation instructions used in XyCraft is provided here; however, do note, that changes may
occur that don't match to the
file here given this is a shallow manual copy. I'll try my best to update this once per Minecraft Version. The current
version applies to `1.21.3`, though most values are the same for the `1.21.1` versions as well.

The intended use case for these is to help determine the layout as well as what to set in a data pack.

## Example Recipes

Coming soon. This will provide examples, as well as demonstrations of how to make your own Extractor or other machine
recipes in XyCraft.

## Wiki
While I would LOVE to have a wiki up and running still, this is still in progress sadly. It is neither amusing, nor trivial to get right üòù
